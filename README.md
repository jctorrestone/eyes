# Eyes
The goal of this project is to make two eyes follow the cursor at any direction it goes. 

# Installation
These are the steps for the installation:<br>
    1. You can download or clone the project<br>
    2. Open the index.html in your browser<br>
    3. It should start running once it is opened in the browser<br>
    4. Just move the cursor anywhere and watch the eyes move<br>
